        <h3>General Interests and Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            My two favorite things to do in my free time are listening to music
            and drawing. I love sketching and doodling whenever I get my hands on
            a piece of paper and a pencil. When it comes to music, I listen to mainly
            reggaeton, rap, and hip-hop with my favorite artists being<i> Bad Bunny, Playboi Carti,</i>
            and <i> Tyler the Creator.</i>



        </p>

        <p>
            Just to give you a better idea of what my interests are, here are clips of some of
            my favorite songs, films, and TV shows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Bad Bunny Neverita (Live Performance)</h4>

        <h3>Favorite Websites </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of my favorite sites to find videos to watch is a classic website, and most likely
                known by whoever is reading this, and that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"> Youtube
                </a>. I watch youtube almost everyday on my television and I find it a perfect source of media
                for when I have some free time or to watch something while I eat.<br>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">

                        width="100"></a>
            </li>
            <li>I like shopping for clothes and one of my favorite places to shop from is <a
                    href="https://www.depop.com" target="_blank"> Depop
                </a>. Depop is great for finding pre-owned clothes and clothes from stores inaccesible in the states
                sometimes. You can also barter for these clothes in a way by offering to pay a lower price than what a
                seller has listed. <br>

            </li>

            <li>I can't live without music and one of my most used streaming platforms of all time is <a
                    href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank"> Spotify
                </a>. I have all of my music and playlists stored on Spotify and what I love the most about it is it's
                social features. On
                Spotify you can add friends and showcase playlists or top streamed artists on your profile. You can also
                make joint playlists
                with someone with Spotify's blend feature. Lossless audio should be coming to Spotify soon as well which
                will make the music
                sound a whole lot better. <br>
                <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">

        <h3> My Projects in This Course</h3>
        <p>
            I plan on working on many projects throughout the course with this page being
            one of them. <br>
            Here's a list of everything I've worked on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For starters, this page is my very first project in this course. My task was to
                create and deploy a simple HTML page. Here's a link to the page:
                <br>
                <a href="https://wilzm.github.io/CUS1172_WilliamPico/milestone1/index.html" target="_blank"> Simple HTML
                    Page</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                My next milesotne on the same project above was adding CSS elements in order to style the page using 
                multiple techniques such as element, id, and class selectors. The CSS also has a dedictaed seperate styling 
                file that is linked to the main HTML file, with some of the styling in the actual HTML file due to the projects
                requirements.
